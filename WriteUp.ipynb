    "The goal of this project is to train a deep neural network drive the car autonomously around a simulated  around a test track in Udacity's driving simulator. The trained model try to predict right steering angles. The network is trained on from a video stream that was recorded while a human was steering the car. The CNN thus clones the human driving behavior.\n",

    "**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**\n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",

    "### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded couple of laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](pic_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to to return to the track after having left the route. These images show what a recovery looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](pic_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I also run the track in the opposite direction, so that there would be steering angle-data equally in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, I also used the training data provided by Udacity. The final model is trained by the data provided by Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training the Network\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I did the tests with the little training data to make it faster and finally with full data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images of all three cameras are used in the training. Side views help the model learn how to recover when the vehicle drives off the center the lane. Steering angle value is get by trial and error. Apparently a better way would be applying Ackerman geometry to calculate proper recover steering angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had trouble getting the generator to work well so I tried to make the data used as lightweight as possible so that it could work directly in memory. Training worked pretty fast and the code was clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preprosessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Images have been converted to HSV color space and only the S channel is used. The extra parts have been removed from the pictures and have been changed to a smaller size (16,32,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Augementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To balance the data, all the images and steering angles have been flipped and added to the training set. This balances data because it makes egual number turns to both sides (left/right).\n",
    "For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original image\n",
    "![alt text](pic_2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipped image\n",
    "![alt text](pic_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "HSV image (S-channel)\n",
    "![alt text](pic_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validating the Network (+Epochs)\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 15% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The ideal number of epochs was 20-25 with model checkpoint and early stopping. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "15% of the data was selected for the validation set.\n",
    "Be sure to randomly shuffle the data before splitting into training and validation sets. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "If model predictions are poor on both the training and validation set (for example, mean squared error is high on both), then this is evidence of underfitting. Possible solutions could be to increase the number of epochs\n",
    "add more convolutions to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model predicts well on the training set but poorly on the validation set (for example, low mean squared error for training set, high mean squared error for validation set), this is evidence of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model is overfitting, a few ideas could be to use dropout or pooling layers use fewer convolution or fewer fully connected layers\n",
    "collect more data or further augment the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the model will make good predictions on both the training and validation sets. The implication is that when the network sees an image, it can successfully predict what angle was being driven at that moment.\n"
